# pmgame

Terminal-based game for Linux similar to Pac-Man and written entirely in Haskell using [Brick](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick).

This is still a work in progress, but the basic game is working.

## Things to do

* Improve the entry point and add a start screen.
* Implement high scores.
* Fix ghost movement logic so they chase the player.
* Make more levels, change level specification and level loading.
* Eventually change ghosts so that each has its own movement logic.
* Add fruit.
* Write a better README.
